			<li>Right click to clear radio buttons</li>

		<h1 class="h2NoUnder">Actors</h1>
		<p>There are four main types of Actors available in the system:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>PC</li>
			<li>NPC</li>
			<li>Animal</li>
			<li>Town Charter</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In this section I will go over the common areas of the these sheets.<br /><br /></p>

	<div>
		<h1 class="h2NoUnder">Items/Item Types</h1>
		<p>There are a number of Item types that can be created for use within the system:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Item - General equipment</li>
			<li>Weapon - Personal and Vehicle weapons</li>
			<li>Critical Injury - Create Critical injuries with modifiers</li>
			<li>Animal Temperament - Animal Qualities & Flaws</li>
			<li>Talent - Talents for use within the system</li>
			<li>Amenities - Details town projects</li>
			<li>Weapon Quality - Weapon Qualities & Conditions (Special Items)</li>
		</ul>
		<p><br /><br /></p>
		<h3>Item</h3>
		<p>
			The item sheet is for generic items for use within the game.
			<br />
			The modifiers tab allows you to add any +/- effects using the item may have on the PCs attributes or skills.
			<br />
			&nbsp;<span class="modifiers-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
			<br />
			Modifiers have an in-system effect once the item is "Active" (Not in your horses saddlebag).
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		<h3>Weapon</h3>
		<p>
			Select the type on the sheet (Ranged or Melee) and the sheet will dynamically change to the relevant stats for that weapon type. The Class field is a text field which allow
			you to classify the weapon. This is not a required field and can be left blank.
			<br />
			&nbsp;<span class="melee-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
			<br />
			&nbsp;<span class="ranged-img">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
			<br />
			For a Melee weapon the range will be set to Engaged, for Ranged weapons select the appropriate range from the dropdown list. The Cost field will convert the input to a
			currency so all you need to enter is the number e.g., 15000 and it will reformat as US$15,000.00.
			<br /><br />
			The stats on the sheet will be used in rolls when the weapon is "Active".
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		<h3>Talent</h3>
		<p>
			This item type enables you to create talents for your game either homebrew or from the rulebook by adding descriptions to the rich test field. When dragged on to a PCs sheet,
			these will appear on the Skills tab and can be viewed by the player by clicking on the name.
			<br /><br />
			<b> NOTE:</b><br />
			With the exception of the "Nerves of Steel" talent, which will automatically add -2 to Stress rolls and the "Pack Mule" talent which increases total Encumbrance, Talents do
			not currently have an effect in the system so any impact deriving from a Talent needs to be applied manually during the game.
			<br /><br />
			For instance, the Compassion (Medic Talent) allows the PC to push their roll multiple times but the system will by default only allow a roll to be pushed once. In this
			situation the player should use the check box in the chat window "Allow multi-push". <br />
			When the situation complies with the Talent criteria the player checks the box, <b>before pushing the roll</b>, they then PUSH as normal and a Stress point is added to their
			sheet.
		</p>

		<h3>Critical Injury</h3>
		<p>
			Critical Injury items can be dragged on to PC sheets to record permanent injuries as well as apply the appropriate roll modifiers as defined on the Modifiers tab.
			<br /><br />

		<h1 class="h2NoUnder">Recommended Add-on Modules</h1>
		<p>While not necessary to use the Tales of the old West system, I would recommend installing the following Add-on modules as they make the GM's job a lot easier: <br /></p>
		<ul>
			<li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
				<strong>Dice So Nice:</strong> <br />Alien RPG supports 2 dice face types. The new version also allows the GM to add animated effects to dice rolls.
			</li>
			<li style="padding-bottom: 2%">
				<strong>Quick Insert - Search Widget:</strong> <br />Allows you to quickly search for assets and drag them directly on to the scene, sheets or rich text fields.
			</li>
		</ul>
